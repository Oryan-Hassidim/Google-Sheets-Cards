        <h1>Privacy Policy for Google Sheets Cards</h1>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Google Sheets Cards is a web application that allows users to interact with and edit Google Sheets in a card
            view. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Our app does not collect or store any personal information on external servers. All data processing occurs
            locally in your web browser.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>No user data is stored on our servers. All information is stored locally on your device or within your Google
            account.</p>

        <h2>4. Google Sheets Integration</h2>
        <p>Our app integrates with Google Sheets. When you use our app, you grant it permission to access and modify
            your Google Sheets data. We do not have access to this data, and it remains subject to Google's privacy
            policy.</p>

        <h2>5. User Rights and Data Access</h2>
        <p>Our app requires access to your Google Sheets data to provide its functionality. This access allows you to
            view and edit your sheets through our card-based interface. However, it's important to understand that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect, store, or retain any of this data on our servers. All data remains within your Google
                account.</li>
            <li>Your right to access, edit, or delete your data is managed through your Google account. We do not have
                any control over this data beyond the temporary access needed for the app to function.</li>
            <li>You can revoke our app's access to your Google account at any time through your Google account settings.
                This will prevent our app from accessing your sheets but will not affect the data within your Google
                account.</li>
            <li>As we do not store your data, we cannot provide, modify, or delete any data from our end. All such
                actions are performed directly on your Google Sheets through our interface.</li>
            <li>You have the right to stop using our app at any time, which will cease any interaction between our app
                and your Google Sheets data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your data seriously, even though we do not store it ourselves. Our security measures
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We use Google's official authentication protocols to securely access
                your Google Sheets data. This ensures that your login credentials are never exposed to our app.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> All data transmission between our app and Google's servers occurs
                over encrypted HTTPS connections, protecting your data in transit.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> As our app processes data locally in your browser, we minimize the
                risk of unauthorized access to your information.</li>
            <li><strong>No Data Storage:</strong> Since we don't store your data on our servers, there's no risk of a
                data breach on our end.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> We keep our app and its dependencies up to date to protect against
                known vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Scope:</strong> We request only the necessary permissions from Google to perform the
                app's functions, minimizing potential exposure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While we implement these security measures, please note that the security of your Google account and the data
            within your Google Sheets is primarily managed by Google. We recommend following Google's security best
            practices, such as using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any significant changes by
            posting a notice on our website.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
